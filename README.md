## About

Senior full stack software engineer with 5 years of professional experience delivering end to end production web systems.

I work on projects at any stage of their lifecycle. This includes joining existing production systems, understanding business and technical constraints, and improving or extending them, as well as starting new projects from requirement gathering and technical planning through development, deployment, and production support.

My experience includes building full fledged systems from scratch, working extensively on legacy codebases, and performing application and data migrations while keeping systems stable in production.

As Python conventions state, "Simple is better than complex." I follow the same approach while creating solutions. I avoid unnecessary complexity, messy code, and over-engineering, and focus on clear and maintainable implementations.

## What I Do

- Take ownership of systems from requirements to production and ongoing support
- Join existing products, understand constraints, and improve reliability and scalability
- Design and build backend driven applications used in real workflows
- Build complete frontend applications where required for product delivery
- Handle technology and data migrations with minimal disruption
- Work independently, as part of a team, or in coordination roles depending on needs

## Technical Scope

- Backend development using Python
- Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, and Flask
- API design with long term stability in mind
- Frontend development using React for full fledged applications
- Data modeling, migrations, and performance work
- Background processing, caching, and async workflows
- Cloud deployments across AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and DigitalOcean
- Integration with CRMs, external platforms, payment gateways, and third party APIs
- Automation and browser based workflows
- Production debugging, performance tuning, and reliability fixes

AI tools are used selectively to improve development efficiency. Engineering decisions and final responsibility remain with the team.

## Repositories

This is a personal GitHub account.

Most professional work is maintained in private company repositories and cannot be shared publicly. Public repositories here contain selective, non proprietary code such as isolated components, experiments, and reduced patterns derived from real production systems.

They represent how I approach problems, not the full scope of systems I have worked on.
