## Summary

Full stack software engineer with 5 years of professional experience building, migrating, and operating production web systems.

I have delivered applications from scratch to production, worked extensively on legacy codebases, performed framework and data migrations, and supported systems under real user load. My work is primarily backend-focused, with frontend development where it is required for product delivery.

This is a personal GitHub account. Most production work is maintained in official company repositories and cannot be shared publicly. Code here is selective and non-proprietary.
